# Student-Management-Data

Student Management Data is a java-based application creation project for managing student data from Microsoft SQL Server databases. The function of this application is to facilitate the database admin to manage the contents of the database, as well as students to check their own student data. In this application the admin can perform various functions like SQL Server, such as create, update, delete and select data in the database table. Whereas students can only use the Select or Display function to display student data.
  
The advantages of using this application are:
  
  1. We do not need to open the SMSS SQL Server application to access 
  the Database, but just simply open the Student Data Management 
  application. So, it can save RAM consumption and does not impose 
  processing on the computer.
  
  2. Ease of doing CRUD functions (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the 
  data. We no longer need to write complicated queries or search for 
  GUI functions on SQL Server. In this application we can perform all 
  CRUD functions in the same from so that data management can be 
  done more efficiently and quickly.
  
The disadvantages of using this application are:
  
  1. The computer must have a SQL Server Database, with the same 
  database configuration. In accordance with what has been 
  programmed in NetBeans Java, such as the database name, table 
  name, number and the same column name. If not, an application error 
  will occur.
